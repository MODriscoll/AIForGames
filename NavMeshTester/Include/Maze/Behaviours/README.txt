// IDEA ON HOW TO USE A BLACKBOARD
// USE A BLACKBOARD THAT STORES THE INRANGE DISTANCE
// AN AGENT NEEDS TO BE IN TO FOLLOW THE FLOW FIELD
// THE GAME CAN GRADUALLY INCREASE THE LENGTH AND DURING
// EXECUTE THE LENGTH CAN JUST BE RETRIEVED. THE EXECUTE
// CAN THEN CHECK IF AGENT IS IN RANGE AND APPLY FORCE ACCORDINGLY
// MAYBE ALSO HAVE AN INFLUENCE VALUE SO THE LONGER THE GAME
// HAS BEEN ACTIVE THE GREATER THE FORCE CALCULATED WILL BE

// MAKE ANOTHER BEHAVIOUR THAT DETECTS IF A SURVIVOUR HAS REACHED THE
// END. IF THEY HAVE, THEY WILL POST TO THE BLACKBOARD THAT THEY HAVE
// COMPLETED.
// ALSO MAYBE IF THEY COME ACCROSS THE MONSTER, THEY WILL POST THE MONSTERS
// LAST KNOWN POSITION

// MAYBE MOVE THE MAZE POINTER ( ALSO FLOW FIELD POINTER ) TO THE BLACKBOARD
// DOING THIS SHOULD ELEMINATE HAVING TO RESET THE POINTERS IF THEY EVER WERE TO CHANGE
// INSTEAD, SET THE NEW POINTERS INTO THE BLACKBOARD AND THE BEHAVIOURS CAN GET THE
// INFO FROM THE BLACKBOARD
